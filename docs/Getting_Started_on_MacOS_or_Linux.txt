This is the implementation of the Grand Comics Database in Python
using the Django framework.

For basic information, see the README file in the project's root directory.

After following the steps here go to Getting_Started.txt for information on
how to setup the environment using a dump from GCD project.

This file explains the specifics of setting up a development environment
on MacOS X or Linux.  Note that your Linux distribution's package management
system may be able to handle much of the installation work for you.

This file assumes that you're cloning the "master" branch from github.
If you want to run the current production branch, please inquire
as to which branch is current at http://groups.google.com/group/gcd-tech/

To run:

0.  You'll need Python.  We are currently using Python 2.7.

===============================================================================
= Git and GitHub
===============================================================================

** Install git, which may be found through http://github.com/

** Clone the repository.  The GitHub web page is:
https://github.com/GrandComicsDatabase/gcd-django
See the GitHub help documentation for options, and contact the gcd-tech
mailing list if you need assistance.

===============================================================================

MySQL
=====
Install MySQL 5.1.  Put the following lines in your /etc/my.cnf

default-character-set = utf8
default-storage-engine = InnoDB

These settings will save you from accidentally not using foreign keys or
transactions, or from trying to stuff unicode into an 8-bit character set.
None of those are fun to debug or recover from.

If installing using Linux packages of some sort and also using pip/virtualenv
for Python libraries as described below, you will also need
RPM: mysqlclient-devel
Debian package: libmysqlclient-dev

ICU library
===========
Install the ICU library, which is C/C++ and may require compilation.
You will need this before you install the Python modules, as one of them
depends on it.  This is specifically icu4c, not the Java icu4j.

libicu builds fine on Mac OS X, and pre-built packages should exist for most
linux distributions:

http://site.icu-project.org/
RPM: libicu
Debian package: libicu48

If using pip/virtualenv to build Python libraries, you will also need
the icu-devel RPM or the libicu48-dev Debian package (libicu-dev on newest
Ubuntu).

If you do compile libicu yourself, the instructions on their readme.html
are absurdly complex.  Just do this (which worked on Mac OS X Snow Leopard):

bash:~$ tar xzvf icu-whatever.tgz # version 49 at the time of writing
bash:~$ cd icu/source
bash:~/icu/source$ ./configure
bash:~/icu/source$ gnumake
bash:~/icu/source$ sudo gnumake install

Image libraries
===============
You will need some additional libraries for PIL to be able to support some
of the common image formats.  If you are not doing any image editing, this
is not required.

See http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ for further information.

TODO: Document specifics.

CSSTidy
=======
Install CSSTidy, which should exist as a package for most Linux distributions
(and possibly for MacPorts as well):
http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/
RPM: csstidy
Debian package: csstidy

===============================================================================
= Python and bootstrapping the library install.
===============================================================================

Python
======
Install Python if it did not come with your system.  Python 2.7 is recommended.
http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

If installing from packages you'll also need development package for python
(python-dev on Ubuntu).

setuptools
==========
Install setuptools to get easy_install, which we primarily use to install
better installation tools.  
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/0.6c11
See the web page for installation instructions.

pip
===
Use easy_install to install pip:

bash:~$ easy_install pip

If you have problems, see http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/

virtualenv
==========
We recommend using virtualenv, but it is optional.  It will allow you to isolate
the libraries you need for the GCD, and not contaminate your system python.

Use pip to install virtualenv, and then create a virtualenv for use with the
GCD.  For this example, we will create one called "gcd" in a directory called
"virtualenvs".  

bash:~$ pip install virtualenv
# lots of output
bash:~$ mkdir virtualenvs
bash:~$ cd virtualenvs
bash:~/virtualenvs$ virtualenv gcd
New python executable in gcd/bin/python
Installing setuptools............done.
Installing pip...............done.
bash:virtualenvs$ ls
gcd
bash:virtualenvs$ source gcd/bin/activate
(gcd)bash:virtualenvs$

# Note that "(gcd)" at the beginning of the prompt.  Now all Python execution
and installation will occur inside of the "gcd" virtual env, i.e. ~/virtualenvs/gcd.

For more on installing and using virtualenv, see
http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html

distribute
==========
Finally, some of the libraries require "distribute", a replacement for
setuptools which you installed earlier. If it is globally installed the setup
of virtualenv will use that one, you can observe this in its output.  The
libraries we use may require a newer version than already installed.  A botched
installation of distribute can leave your python system unusable, so this is
where using a virtualenv can be handy, as a botched virtualenv can just be
thrown away.  If you break your system python, see the distribute package's
documentation for repair instructions.

The main way to break your python setup is to try to install distribute with pip.
That is supposed to work, but often does not.  Instead, one can use
distribute_setup.py

So, if you are in a virtualenv one of the following can be safely attempted:
(gcd)bash:~$ pip install -U distribute
or
(gcd)bash:~$ easy_install -U distribute

If that does not work, or you are installing globally, as of this writing, it
is safer to do

(gcd)bash:~$ curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
(gcd)bash:~$ python distribute_setup.py

Now, after installing up to four different package management libraries, you are
finally ready to actually install the libraries needed for the GCD.

===============================================================================
= Python libraries
===============================================================================

Assuming you've already activated the virtualenv (but not installed anything
further in it), and cloned the git repo to ~/git/gcd-django, use pip and
our checked-in requirements file to install all necessary Python libraries.
Make certain that you have any C/C++ libraries already compiled and installed
(such as libicu, and optionally some supplemental libraries for PIL depending
on how much of the image editing you want to be able to do).

You can also just run this pip command without the virtualenv to install
everything into your system python's site-packages tree, but we recommend to
use virtualenv.

Debian packages, RPMs and MacPorts packages are available for many of the
Python libraries, and if you prefer to use those, please remember to
make a copy of requirements.txt and remove the libraries that you
installed through other means.  If the OS packages were of older Python
library verions, you may need to add versions to your requirements.txt
or adjust the versions to match.  See the pip documentation for the
requirements.txt format. 

This file tries to install the latest versions of everything.
PLEASE NOTE:  If the latest version of PyICU does not match the version of
libicu that you installed, you may need to try an older version of PyICU,
which should generally work fine with the GCD.  For instance PyICU 1.0
was known to work with libicu 4.4 as of October 2012.

(gcd)bash:~/git/gcd-django$ pip install -r requirements.txt
# A ton of output happens here, especially for PIL compilation.
# You can also just open up the requirements. text and install each line separately.
# It is safe to re-run pip, since if everything installed properly, it will just
# check each library and skip it as already installed.

This should install Django and every other python package you need to
run the site and post code reviews for the project.
